    <p>I assume you own Minecraft right? If you don't then GO BUY IT.</p>
    <p>Anyways we need a version of Java that can run all the shit.</p>
    <p> You can go to <a href="https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/"
            target="_blank">https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/</a> to download a good Java version.</p>
    <p>You need to select the following settings for most basic ahh Windows install</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block; width: 150px;">Operating System:</b> Windows (duh)</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block; width: 150px;">Architecture:</b> x64</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block; width: 150px;">Package Type:</b> JDK</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block; width: 150px;">Version:</b> 17 - LTS</li>
    </ul>

            target="_blank">DIRECT LINK</a> to .msi if you can't be bothered</p>
    <br />
    <h2><a href="#prismlauncher" class="noblue" id="prismlauncher">PRISM LAUNCHER</a></h2>
    <h3>Downloading Prism Launcher</h3>
    <p>Now here is where the fun part starts. You need to install the <b>Prism Launcher</b> from <a
            href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">https://prismlauncher.org/</a></p>
    <img src="images/guide2.png" height="250" />
    <p>Run the installer, all the defaults are just fine, just click next next next finish until the Prism Launcher starts.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <h3>Installing Prism Launcher</h3>
    <p>Select your language <span style="font-size: 80%;">(I'd suggest American English just for convenience sake...)</span>, and then you get to select your Java version.
        If you installed Java manually earlier then you should know what to pick, but everyone else pick the one inside the red circle.
        You can also increase the max memory allocation if your PC has a lot of RAM, in case things get very populated in the server.</p>
    <img src="images/guide3.png" height="400" />
    <p>If you want to mess with the launcher settings then be my guest, but I'd just click "Finish" because who cares.
    </p>
    <p>---</p>
    <h3>Mod Pack</h3>
    <p>Now, that we have the launcher installed we can get to installing the actual mod pack...</p>
    <p>You can download the mod pack from here:</p>
    <p><a href="resources/BrahkieMMP.zip">BrahkieMMP.zip</a> (29 677 kb) MD5: bd5ee5171de0b1c81c16d9311f67418</p>
    <p>Once you have that on your disk in a place you can remember, please click "Add Instance" from the Prism Launcher.
        Then select "Import" from the left menu.
        Then click "Browse" and locate the BrahkieMMP.zip and select it.</p>
    <img src="images/guide4.png" height="400" />
    <p>---</p>
    <h3>Micro$ðŸ¤®ft account</h3>
    <p>Your Prism Launcher should now look something like this</p>
    <img src="images/guide5.png" height="400" />
    <p>Excited to play, you go click "Launch" and OH NO what happened!</p>
    <img src="images/guide6.png" />
    <p>Yeah... Prism Launcher wants your IP, postcode, CC number and the 3 numbers on the other side to verify that you actually <i>own</i> Minecraft.</p>
    <p>We can fix this though by clicking the "Yes" button, and when the settings panel opens click "Add Microsoft" intop right.</p>
    <p>It asks you to input a code on a web page, but the easiest way to MAKE SURE this works, is to do the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com/</a> with your
            default browser</li>
        <li>Log in with the same account that owns Minecraft</li>
        <li>Go back to the Prism Launcher</li>
        <li>Double click the code to select it, then copy it (works on any word btw if you didn't know)</li>
        <li>Open the link in the dialog box</li>
        <li>Paste the code in</li>
        <li>Verify your login</li>
        <li>Confirm, accept, go ahead etc...</li>
        <li>Go back to Prism Launcher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should now have your Microsoft account linked to the Prism Launcher.</p>
    <p>If you got to the account linking part through the "Launch" button, the game will now attempt to start, otherwise go ahead and click "Launch".
        This means lots of downloading and scary text going really fast, don't worry.
        When the downloads are gone it might seem that nothing happens for a while, but be patient and eventually the game will launch :)
    </p>

    <h2><a href="#minecraft" class="noblue" id="minecraft">Minecraft</a></h2>
    <p>Go ahead and set your preferences and whatnot, but when you are ready click "Multiplayer" from the main menu,
        and accept the whatever warning it says to accept (don't know what it says because I didn't read it).</p>
    <p>To add the server:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click "Add Server"</li>
        <li>Give it a custom name (can be anything, this is just for you)</li>
        <li>Paste the server address in the other box: 51.254.149.249:25601</li>
        <li>Click "Done"</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/guide9.png" height="400" />
    <p>You should now see the server in the server list. Just select it and click "Join".</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <h3>Account linking</h3>
    <img src="images/guide10.png" height="400" />
    <p>idk ask the mods or something I never got past this and they won't reply to my DMs ðŸ˜­</p>
    <p>You need to go in the minecraft channel and use <span style="font-family: monospace;">/link &lt;whitelist-code&gt;</span>. And try joining again.</p>
    <h2><a href="#other" class="noblue" id="other">OTHER</a></h2>
    <h3>MAP OF THE WORLD</h3>
    <p>We have a semi-frequently updated map in <a href="http://51.254.149.249:8194" target="_blank">http://51.254.149.249:8194</a></p>
    <p>It has live player updates, but the world itself is not live and is instead rendered out periodically.</p>
